Repository description
	This is my C++ studio repository. It will host my implementation of common algorithms, utilities, etc.

Document formating conventions
	Python style indentation. 4-character indent per level.

C++ is better than C
    C++ has more powerful abstracting and modeling features.
    C++ is more type-safe which enables compilers to help us more efficently.
    C++ has more elegant and richer native support of common data structures and algorithms
        Common container data structures
        Common algorithms
    C++ has more powerful native support of string operations
        String
        Regular expression
    C++ has native support of concurent programming
        Atomic primitives
        Ordering primitives
        Threading
        Mutex
        Conditional variable
    C++ has elegant native support of dynamic resourcer lifecycle management.
        Smart pointers
    C++ has more powerful native support of error handling.
    C++ has native support of common utilities
        Common utilities
